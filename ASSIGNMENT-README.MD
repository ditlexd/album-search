ASSIGNMENT

Below is the task that we would like you to perform.

Using the Deezer REST API (https://developers.deezer.com/api) perform the following actions and display the results using the attached designs. (You might need to create a free account with Deezer.) PS their API is not CORS enabled, that can be worked around by using a proxy like in the example code.

The assignment will cover the following:

1. Create an autocomplete search for artist that populates a option list while you type - marked with (1) in the design asset.

2. When clicking on an item in the result set you should present and list the ALBUMS for that artist as displayed in the attached design - marked with (2) in the design asset.

3. When clicking an ALBUM you should expand a field like the one in the design under the headline :Planet Earth and list information from the album - marked with (3) in the design asset.

Utilize the Deezer API to perform the tasks above using React/Redux (and any other libraries you see fit). The code in this folder can be used as a starting point. Description of how to run it is in [CRA-README.md](CRA-README.md).

Solutions using other frameworks will also be evaluated, but will require more explanation from the applicant.

Two design assets are included in the 'design' folder:

![Search Result](design/Search-Result.jpg)

Good luck!
